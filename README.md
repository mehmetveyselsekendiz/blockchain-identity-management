# Identity Management Blockchain Implementation

This project is an implementation of an distance education system.  
- The education model is managed with an blockchain so the education and student data will be tracible and also secure.  
- Student's identity and attandence informations will be stored in the blockchain.  
- Every student has an id which is based on a blockchain wallet and they will use it for joining the classes.  
- With the system also, education managment will get some control over students like limiting courses which students could join, tracing their attandence time.
